# DASH_LACRIME_Deployment_pythonanywhere

Here is a dashboard made with plotly Dash and deployed on pythonanywhere.com

Data description & file link can be found at :https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8

I had to reduce the size of the dataset (100k lines i.o +600k) to be able to use PA free tier,

You can find the preprocessing & data cleaning I made in 'preprocess_reduce_df.py' to get 'LA_Crime_clean.csv' file

I use Dash RangeSlider, dropdowns & callbacks to display multiple graphs about LA's crime figures from 2020 to today

Final version on this webapp can be find @http://riss.pythonanywhere.com/
